## About the Project
**FuelFMCW** is a decentralized application (DApp) built to raise funds transparently for FMC Weekend, a fest organised by IIT (BHU), VARANASI. 
It leverages **blockchain technology** to ensure secure, traceable, and tamper-proof fundraising â€” removing all the opacity and centralization 
typically found in college-level or non-profit donations.

> ðŸ’¡ With Web3, donors can directly contribute Ether (ETH) to the fest, leave a message of appreciation, and view a real-time,
> on-chain list of all contributions â€” **without trusting any middleman**.
